## ðŸ”§ Technologies Covered

- **Node.js** â€“ JavaScript runtime for building fast and scalable network applications  
- **Express.js** â€“ Minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework  
- **MongoDB** â€“ NoSQL database for storing and managing data  
- **Mongoose** â€“ Elegant MongoDB object modeling for Node.js  
- **Nodemon** â€“ Automatically restarts the server on file changes during development  
- **Postman** â€“ API testing and development tool  
- **Joi** â€“ Data validation library for JavaScript

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Strengthen backend development skills  
- Understand API creation, validation, and routing  
- Learn how to integrate MongoDB with Node.js  
- Experiment with error handling and best practices  
- Build a solid foundation for full-stack development
